# SnapTap-CS2
Bypass key binding lock for CS2

This repository contains a config for Counter Strike 2, which uses null binding and bypasses the restriction of entering commands and aliases. 
The config was written for game version 1.40.3.3 (407), and it works stably on it.
To edit the bindings, you need to open nulltick.cfg and change it to what you need.
