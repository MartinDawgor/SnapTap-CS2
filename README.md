Bypass key binding lock for CS2

WARNING!!!
Due to the extremely unstable operation of VacNet, there is a possibility of getting a game ban. The author of the script is not responsible for your accounts, all your actions for review are at your own risk.

This repository contains a config for Counter Strike 2, which uses null binding and bypasses the restriction of entering commands and aliases. 
The config was written for game version 1.40.3.3 (407), and it works stably on it.
To edit the bindings, you need to open nulltick.cfg and change it to what you need.

Installation instructions:
1) Unpack the archive into a folder with configs, so that the multi folder and the nulltick config are in the same folder along the path \game\csgo\cfg.
2) Go to nulltick and change the binds if necessary.
3) Go into the game and write exec nulltick, after which we have fun
